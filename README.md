# Memory-Forensics
## home baked scripts for memory forensics

### VolatilityExport-Textfiles.bat

is an MSWindows batch file to aid text export of more common Volatility tools

Will need to have Python 2.7 or 3 and Volatility 2 or 3 installed

Check the drive letters and Run script as administrator

*Autovolatility (not mine, see fork) uses multithreading so it'll be quicker
